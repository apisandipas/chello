# Chello - A Trello Clone in TanStack Start


Built as my first TanStack Start project in order to learn the ins and outs.

### Using
- Bun
- Tanstack Start
- Tanstack Router
- Prisma
- Tailwind

### Development

Install `bun` if your haven't already.

Run `bun intall` to satisfy dependencies.

This project comes with a `docker-compose` file to run your Database in. Totally optional.
To spin that up run: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up`

Run `bun dev` to start the development server
